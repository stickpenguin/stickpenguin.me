		specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
		electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
		the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
		and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
		including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
